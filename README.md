# GreetHub - another event manager

âœ¨ **This workspace has been generated by [Nx, a Smart, fast and extensible build system.](https://nx.dev)** âœ¨


## Start the app

In order to run the projet locally, you need to start :
- the frontend server (in Angular)
- the API server (in .Net Core)
- a local MongoDB instance


### To start the frontend
you will first need to run `npm install` once. Then run 
```
npm run serve:front
``` 
This should open your browser on http://localhost:4200/.

### To start the API server
If this is your first run, you might need to run `npm run prepare` first.  
You can use Nx and/or dotnet CLI to start the live server with 
```
npm run serve:api
```
This should open your browser on https://localhost:5001/ where a swaggerUI is running.  

NB: This project can also be used by any recent version of **Visual Studio**.

### To start the MongoDB server
Any running instance of MongoDB will be enough. Database and collection are automatically created as soon a you create a first event.  
Hint: You can easily have a MongoDB server up and running by using Docker: 
````
% docker pull mongo
% docker run -d -p27017:27017 mongo 
````

## Running the tests

### To start the frontend tests  
Front end test are using Jest.  
```
npm start test:front
```

### To start the backend tests  
In spite of a lot of efforts, I could not configure Nx to run the test project (any hint will be welcome ðŸ˜…).  

As a result, you can only run them by **opening the apps.sln file in Visual Studio** (any recent version should work).
